# Introduction

**Note**: This guide assumes that you’ve read and understood the [Decor Guidelines](https://github.com/decor-discord/.github/blob/main/GUIDELINES.md). If in doubt, join and ask your question in the official [Decor Discord server](https://discord.gg/dXp2SdxDcP).

This is NOT an official guide, nor was it written by a member of the Decor team. I am simply a user.

Before starting, you will need to decide which type of decoration you want to make. You can of course mix them up\!

I will divide decorations into different categories, all with their unique traits and charm:

- **Effect Decoration**: This category has effects around your profile picture, such as sparkles, fire, energy, etc.  
- **Apparel Decoration**: This category makes your profile picture look like it is wearing clothes or accessories, such as a hat, animal ears, glasses, etc.  
- **Object Decoration**: This category features one or multiple objects next to your profile picture, such as weapons, tools, etc..  
- **Character Decoration**: This category features one or more characters doing an action, peeking behind the profile picture, moving around, etc.  
- **Misc Decoration**: This category contains any other misc. graphics such as UI elements, abstract images, etc.

In addition to these categories of decoration, there exist two types of decorations, **still images** and **animations**. Avatar decorations offer lots of creativity, you can have 2D art, 3D animations, a photo of your pet, you name it\!

In this guide, you will learn how to create a 2D animated **Effect Decoration**, a 3D animated **Object Decoration**, a simple still **Apparel Decoration**, and a simple animated **Character Decoration**.

# Project Setup and Limitations

Before starting to make your decoration, you have to set your project up correctly and know the limitations of decorations in Decor.

Your exported decoration should be **under 3MB** and have **square dimensions**, and the format must be **APNG** *(file extension will be **.png** no matter if it’s a still image or an animation\!).* I recommend [https://ezgif.com/apng-maker](https://ezgif.com/apng-maker) to convert your images and animations to the **APNG** format.

For **animated decorations**, you can choose a frame rate of up to 60 FPS, and the animation can have up to around 1200 frames **(*do not)***.

If you decide to animate your decoration at 60 FPS, be aware that the file size will be difficult to reduce\! Also, the first frame will be what shows up by default, so I recommend making your profile picture mostly visible at first.

In the template, the blue “Status” circle is where your status icon will be, keep in mind that your status icon will always be OVER your decoration\! So better avoid placing stuff there.

And most importantly, don’t be scared to **scale down** your finished decoration to make it under 3MB, and look at it zoomed-out to see if its content is easily distinguishable at a small scale\!


# Effect Decoration

An **Effect Decoration**’s appeal is most often in its *motion*, so animation here is important\! Of course you can always use a still image, but it won’t be as cool :(

Here, I hand drew and animated a simple waterbending animation around the profile picture. I’m using the software Clip Studio Paint, but you can use the software/app of your choice.

If you want to animate for free on PC, you can use [**Krita**](https://krita.org/en/download/) or [**OpenToonz**](https://opentoonz.github.io/e/#point). If you’re on mobile, you can use **Ibis Paint X** or **FlipaClip.**

I first started by importing the template and drawing lines to decide the path of the waterbending, this is very important for the movement to be sensical\! Since this is a waterbending animation, the movement must be more flowy and curvy.

## - IMG PLACEHOLDER

I made a rough version of the animation to turn my idea into something I can see.

Then, I made the final animation and added color.

Finally, I threw the animation into After Effects for the post-process improvements and it’s done\!

# Apparel Decoration

For this apparel decoration, we will use a site called [**Photopea**](https://www.photopea.com/), which is a free and online version of Photoshop.

Simply import the template, **create a new layer**, draw whatever you want on it, make the **template layer** invisible, export as png, and use [https://ezgif.com/apng-maker](https://ezgif.com/apng-maker) to convert it to **APNG**.

*(I forgot to convert to APNG in the video.. oops)*

# Object Decoration

For this object decoration, I first made a 3D animation in Blender.

Then I imported the animation in After Effects to add a smoke puff and some post-process improvements, and it’s done\!

# Character Decoration

For this character decoration, we will use Google Images to find a transparent gif of the character.

Make sure to click the **Tools** button, then set **Color** to **Transparent**, and **Type** to **GIF**.

If you have correctly read the [Decor Guidelines](https://github.com/decor-discord/.github/blob/main/GUIDELINES.md), you will know that random non-creative corner images are not allowed. To make sure your decoration isn’t treated as such, you can add a border around your profile picture in addition to the character. If you’re too lazy to make it yourself, I have provided a simple blue border that you can use\!

After finding the transparent gif you want, let’s go to [Clipchamp](https://app.clipchamp.com/). First, import the template, then the border, and finally the gif of your character. Shorten the layers to change the length of the animation. Move and resize the character so it doesn’t cover the red-ish circle. *(If you’re having trouble with moving the layers, try refreshing the page each time it stops working, it’s a bit finicky).*

Once you’re happy with how it looks, delete the template layer and export as a gif\!

Now you can go to [https://ezgif.com/remove-background](https://ezgif.com/remove-background) to remove the black color from your decoration *(you can raise the “Fuzz %” to increase the removal intensity)*, and convert to apng.
